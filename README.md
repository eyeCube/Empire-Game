# Empire-Game
An ancient game I made in Game Maker back in the day. Knock-off of a popular game. Control planets to build an army and use strategy and tactics to send your units across the solar system, conquering the most valuable planets. Then, crush your opponents by your superior military might. Adjustable difficulty, several different game modes. By Jacob Wharton
