# Empire-Game
An ancient game I made in Game Maker back in the day. Knock-off of a popular game. Control planets to build an army and use strategy and tactics to send your units across the solar system, conquering the most valuable planets. Then, crush your opponents by your superior military might. Adjustable difficulty, several different game modes. By Jacob Wharton

To play, run empire2.exe in compatibility mode for Windows XP

Basic controls:

Click on a planet to select it

Aim with the mouse and right-click to send units from selected planets you control to another planet

Press Q while planet(s) are selected to toggle automatic sending of units to the planet aimed at by the mouse

Advanced controls: Press F1 in-game to view more information and advanced controls including choosing to send out one ship at a time of various sizes, or to send out various ratios of the max number of ships on the planet, etc.

Hints:

Take over planets with low numbers on them -- they are easier to defeat

Try to aim for taking over the largest planets -- they replenish your troops faster

Take over all of the enemies' home planets to win

Ships can fight each other in mid-flight if they come near one another. Larger ships defeat smaller ships.
